if you have python installed:
-> pip install -r requirements.txt --ignore-installed 
(might require pip3 instead it is unclear)

On windows:
then to run it you should run these two commands once !!!from this folder!!!
-> set FLASK_APP=flaskr
-> set FLASK_ENV=development
then you can start the local server
-> flask run

On linux
-> export FLASK_APP=flaskr
-> export FLASK_ENV=development
-> flask run --host=0.0.0.0
verifying the host is necessary for the port forwarding
